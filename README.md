The aim of this project is to automate video splitting.

this project is used to transfer the output of project https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect.git generated by

python scenedetect.py -i d:\video_process\v\zhudi01.mp4 detect-content list-scenes

as xxx-Scenes.csv

to the input of project https://github.com/xinminsu/video-splitter.git as manifest.csv.

so the whole process can do automatic video scene split by splitting a long video into many short scene video pieces.
